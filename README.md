## 📖 Overview

This project is a step-by-step implementation of a **2D swarm simulation using Pygame**, developed as part of structured tasks to learn game development and swarm intelligence.

It consists of three tasks:

1. **Task 1 – Moving the Player**  
   Create a game window where the player moves using keyboard input and stays within boundaries.

2. **Task 2 – Adding Another Class & Interaction**  
   Add enemies and implement collision detection between the player and enemies.

3. **Task 3 – From Player to Autonomous Swarm**  
   Transform the project into a multi-agent simulation where autonomous drones avoid collisions using the separation rule from swarm intelligence.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Task 1 – Moving the Player
- Basic game window with player movement using arrow keys.
- Boundaries to prevent the player from moving outside the screen.
- Structured update and draw functions.

### ✅ Task 2 – Adding Another Class & Interaction
- Added enemies with random movement.
- Collision detection between player and enemies.
- Simple game over scenario when collisions occur.

### ✅ Task 3 – From Player to Autonomous Swarm
- Multiple drones with autonomous movement.
- Separation rule where drones avoid neighbors within a certain distance.
- Smooth and realistic movement by limiting speed.
- Boundary checks to keep drones within the screen.
